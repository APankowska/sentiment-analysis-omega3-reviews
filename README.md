# Sentiment Analysis of Omega-3 Supplement Reviews
Sentiment analysis of customer reviews for omega-3 dietary supplements using NLP techniques in R. The project focuses on health-related review text and customer perceptions expressed in online product feedback.

## Project Overview

This project explores how sentiment analysis can be applied to consumer reviews of omega-3 dietary supplements to better understand customer perceptions, frequently discussed product features, and the relationship between sentiment polarity and numerical ratings.
With the growing popularity of online shopping platforms, customer reviews have become a key source of information influencing purchasing decisions. In the healthcare and wellness domain, however, sentiment analysis remains challenging due to domain-specific terminology and the subjective nature of health-related opinions.
This thesis addresses these challenges by focusing on omega-3 supplements as a case study.

## Introduction

Since the COVID-19 pandemic, interest in dietary supplements has increased significantly, particularly those associated with cardiovascular health, immune support, and cognitive function. Omega-3 fatty acids, including EPA and DHA, are among the most widely consumed supplements worldwide.
Online customer reviews provide rich, user-generated insights into product effectiveness, quality, dosage, and perceived health benefits. However, these reviews are often subjective and  written in informal language, which make automated sentiment analysis challenging, especially for health-ralated topics.
The main goal of this study is to apply sentiment analysis techniques to omega-3 supplement reviews in order to:
 - identify overall sentiment trends
 - determine which product features are most frequently praised or criticized
 - explore the relationship between sentiment polarity and star ratings

## Background

Omega-3 fatty acids are essential polyunsaturated fats that play a crucial role in human health. Since the body cannot synthesize them independently, they must be obtained through diet or supplementation. Despite well-documented health benefits, consumer understanding and expectations regarding omega-3 supplements vary significantly.
Health-related sentiment analysis presents unique challenges:
 - medical and nutritional terminology is often domain-specific,
 - emotions may be expressed indirectly,
 - traditional sentiment lexicons may misclassify health-related expressions.

## Related Work

Existing studies on sentiment analysis in the health domain show a growing interest in analyzing patient opinions, medical forums, and product reviews. However, relatively few studies focus specifically on dietary supplements, and even fewer address omega-3 products directly.
Prior research can be broadly grouped into:
lexicon-based approaches, which rely on predefined sentiment dictionaries but struggle with medical terminology,
machine learning and transformer-based models, which improve accuracy but require large, well-annotated datasets.
Several studies emphasize the need for domain-specific sentiment resources, as general-purpose lexicons may misinterpret neutral medical terms as negative or fail to capture implicit sentiment. Additionally, earlier work often focuses on overall polarity without linking sentiment to specific product features or numerical ratings.
This thesis aims to fill these gaps by conducting a focused sentiment analysis of omega-3 supplement reviews, combining sentiment polarity with feature-level insights and rating analysis.
